# ðŸ“Œ C++ Problem Bank

A collection of C++ implementations for problems from various sources, including university tutorials, prorgramming platforms, and theoretical exercises/concepts.

Since my Data Structures & Algorithms class, I noticed that, while my ability to design an algorithm and write out proofs were improving, I was constantly struggling with writing it out in code. Thus, this repository is a collection of theoretical concepts and problems written in code format to help me improve my ability to code. 

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

### ðŸ”¹ Algorithms
Contains implementations of standard algorithms, categorized by type.

- **Graphs/** â€“ BFS, DFS, Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, Primâ€™s, Kruskalâ€™s, etc.
- **Greedy/** â€“ Huffman Coding, Activity Selection, Interval Scheduling, etc.

### ðŸ”¹ Data_Structures
Implementations of fundamental data structures.

- `linked_list.cpp` â€“ Singly and doubly linked lists.
- `stack.cpp` â€“ Stack implementation using arrays and linked lists.
- `queue.cpp` â€“ FIFO queue implementation.
- `binary_search_tree.cpp` â€“ Basic BST operations.

### ðŸ”¹ Tutorials
Solutions to problems from university tutorials.

- **COMP2823** â€“ Tutorial exercises from my Data Structures and Algorithms (Advanced) class.
- **COMP2022** - Tutorial exercises from my Models of Computation class.
